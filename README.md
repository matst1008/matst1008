- 👋 Hi, I’m Mat!
- 👀 I’m currently working on an aircraft sizing tool (how big should an airplane be for a defined purpose).
- 🌱 I’m currently doing that tool in python with Tkinter GUI. I don't have any official programming training, meaning I'm self taught in anything programming. It's interesting, fun, challenging, and sometimes frustrating.
- 💞️ I’m not actively looking for any collaborations as I'm relatively new to programming, but I'm open to all sorts of ideas.
